* I've put a lot of time and effort into this code. For the last decade
* it's been used to introduce hundreds of students at multiple universities
* to raytracing. It forms the basis of your coursework but you are free
* to continue using/developing forever more. However, I ask that you don't
* share the code or your derivitive versions publicly. In order to continue
* to be used for coursework and in particular assessment it's important that
* versions containing solutions are not searchable on the web or easy to
* download.
*
* If you want to show off your programming ability, instead of releasing
* the code, consider generating an incredible image and explaining how you
* produced it.
